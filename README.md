# Fantasy Football Positional Rankings with Machine Learning

### Short description:
In this repository it ranks fantasy football players inside their position using neural networks (machine learning) based on previous year per-game stats, and grades for current teams positional groups (like Oline grade, QB grade, etc). Includes rankings for RBs, WRs, TEs, and QBs. I used neural networks so the machine learning could account for the complexities of fantasy football. Code is adaptable to be able to be used for future years as well. Unfortunately, I am currently unable to incorporate rookies or a combined ranking of all positions, something I aim to add in the future.

### Requirements:

- install python
- install needed modules and libraries listed at top of each file that you do not already have downloaded.
- install lxml
