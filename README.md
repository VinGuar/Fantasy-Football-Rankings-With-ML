say how main 10 year csv of team grades was obtained by 3 smaller ones. also say how that is done to prevent rate limiting or other errors on large scraping, however doing it as one main scrape at once could have also worked. explain how this process works for future years testing, and how for me I did 3 seperate scrapes with splitting the 10 years up into first 3, next 3, and last 4, and then combined them all to get csv shown in repo
